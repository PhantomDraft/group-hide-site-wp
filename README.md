It provides the following functionalities:

- **Complete Site Hiding:**  
  Allows you to completely hide your website and redirect visitors to a specified page or login page.

- **Role-Based Access Restriction:**  
  Offers the ability to restrict access for specific user roles while keeping the site accessible for others.

- **Selective Content Hiding:**  
  Implements selective content hiding by using IDs or slugs, with individual group settings.

This plugin works excellently in conjunction with **PD Subscription Manager**, where subscription conditions automatically assign users to specific groups (roles), enabling dynamic content restriction.
